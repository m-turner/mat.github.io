When you write up your answers, your goal should be to (1) be
correct, and (2) convince your reader that your answer is correct.
Answers which do not achieve these goals will not be awarded full
credit. To accomplish the second objective, it is helpful if your
work is legible and if all steps are presented, possibly with a
line of explanation.
<p>
We won't always mark the whole problem set.  Each part of each problem that we mark is scored as follows:
<UL class="OS">
	<li> 3/3: Correct numbers/answer, correct logic/methods
	<li> 2/3: Wrong numbers, but correct logic/methods
	<li> 1/3: Wrong numbers, wrong logic/methods
	<li> 0/3: No effort
</UL>
