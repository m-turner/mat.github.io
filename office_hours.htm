<FONT  size=+2>Office hours for Spring 2022-3</FONT>
<p>
I plan to hold office hours in person in 304a Robinson Hall, usually MW 2:45-3:45pm, during the spring term.
<p>
I will miss: Monday January 30 and Wednesday, March 8.
<p>
If you would like to talk to me, please sign up for a slot 
<a href="https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/selfsched?sstoken=UU9IX2VDOFQzTHNkfGRlZmF1bHR8M2ZlYmFlZGI1NWE4Y2E1OWM5ZDFjYjZjYzE2NjQyNGU"><b>here</b></a>. 
Take one or two 10 minute slots depending on how long you think your question(s) will take.  Please try to take a slot next to one that is already filled, if you can.
I am also happy to see students on a drop in basis, but will give precedence to those who signed up. 
<p>
<b> You do not need to ask for permission before you come to office hours.</b> <p>


If you would like to talk to me on zoom rather than in person, please indicate this in then (1) sign up for as you would for an in-person regular slot (2) send me an email letting me know you would like to meet on zoom (so I know to turn zoom on), and (3) meet me in my zoom room at 
<b>https://brown.zoom.us/my/mturner1</b>.  Please only request this if you cannot get to campus.<p>
