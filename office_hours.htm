If you would like to talk to me, please sign up for a slot
<a href="https://calendar.app.google/f1Zs6cyExcQG6vYD7"><b>here</b></a>.
Take one or two 10 minute slots depending on how long you think your question(s) will take.  Please try to take a slot next to one that is already filled, if you can.
I am also happy to see students on a drop in basis, but will give precedence to those who signed up.
<p>
<b> You do not need to ask for permission before you come to office hours.</b> <p>
-->


If you would like to talk to me on zoom rather than in person, please (1) sign up for as you would for an in-person regular slot (2) send me an email letting me know you would like to meet on zoom (so I know to turn zoom on), and (3) meet me in my zoom room at
<b>https://brown.zoom.us/my/mturner1</b>.  Please only request this if you cannot get to campus.<p>
